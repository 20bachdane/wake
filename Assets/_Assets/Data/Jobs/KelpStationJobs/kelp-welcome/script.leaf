{@drJules} I'm glad to see you taking on a Job here!
{@drJules}  The first thing you need to do is go observe a few kinds of Kelp Forests and learn how to use some basic tools on the research ship.
{@player} How do I do that?
{@drJules} Just exit the helm, then use the submarine to travel out to research sites. 
{@drJules}  When you are done, come back to the office and tell me what you've learned.
{@player} Taking out a sub?!? I'm on it!

{@kevin} You're gonna want to take your sub over to Dive Site C.
                    It's marked for you to the east. When you're there, dive.

{@kevin}   Now that you're here, you're going to use your scanner to document all the species. Also, make sure to collect data about the water from that research probe over there.

{@kevin}    Looking good! If you are ready to return, drive your sub back up toward the surface of the water.

{@player}   Alright, I think we got everything?
{@kevin}   Let me check...

$if has.entity:WarmKelpForest, has.entity:Urchin, has.entity:GiantKelp, has.entity:SeaOtter // all scans?
    $set    jobs:kelp-welcome.got.scans = true
    {@kevin}   Nice work down there. You found everything. Let's go back to the ship. 
$else
    {@kevin}   I think you missed something.
    $if !has.entity:WarmKelpForest
        {@kevin}   You should make sure to scan the probe for the water data too.
    $else
        {@kevin}   Are you sure you didn't miss any creatures down there?
    $endif

{@player}   How about now?
{@kevin}   Ummmm...

$if has.entity:WarmKelpForest, has.entity:Urchin, has.entity:GiantKelp, has.entity:SeaOtter // all scans?
    $set    jobs:kelp-welcome.got.scans = true
    {@kevin}   Yep, looks like you scanned everything I was expecting.
                        Head back to your ship when you're ready.
$else
    {@kevin}   No, looks like you're still missing something.
    $if !has.entity:WarmKelpForest
        {@kevin}   The probe is the thing that looks like an archaeic, yet alien computer. Scan it just like a normal critter.
    $else
        {@kevin}   Are you sure you didn't miss any creatures down there? Plants, Animals, Other? 
	Not sure what would even count as other, but it sounded right.

{@player}   We're back. Now what?
{@kevin}   Now that you know some of the most important species in the kelp forest, it's time to learn how they interact.
{@player}   Ok, how?
{@kevin}   Let's go into the experiement room.

{@player}   Alright, I'm in the experimentation room, What's next?
{@kevin}  It's easy. Setup a new tank full of the same kind of water at Site C, add 2 or more species, and observe their behaviours.
{@player}   Then what?
{@kevin}   Then we can know for sure how they relate!
