{@guide}	Okay, this is the {h}Modeling tool{/h}.
            We've gathered a bunch of facts about what eats what in the ecosystem.
            We can combine those facts into {h}Visual Model{/h}. That can help us see how they fit together.
            Make sure to select the ecosystem that matches the current job and click on the {h}Visualize{/h} tab to get started.

{@guide}	So this is the {h}Sync Model{/h}! This is where all your facts get turned into a big simulation.
			What that practically means is we have a bunch of virtual organisms interacting with each other.
            And their interactions are driven by the facts you have.
            So if you've got a fact that says "{pluralnameof Urchin} eat {pluralnameof GiantKelp}", then these virtual Urchins will eat the virtual Giant Kelp.
            More than that, though, you can use the population histories you download from various sites.
            Those histories are represented on the graph by thick faded lines.
            As your virtual organisms eat, and die, and reproduce, their populations will show up on the graph too.
            Your goal is to get those lines to line up with the historical populations!

{@guide}	Once we have a complete Describe Model, we can click the button that says {h}Run Prediction{/h}.
{@guide}	This will provide us with a model forecasting what the site will look like in the future!
{@guide}	If you see dotted lines, those mean that you have observed relationships between organisms but you don't have the exact rates.
{@guide}	Make sure to measure missing rates by using the {h}Measurement Tank{/h}.

{@guide}	Okay, so this is the {h}Intervene Model{/h}. From here you can see what might happen if you intervene in an ecosystem.
            You can determine what would happen if we added more of one kind of organism or removed another kind.
            You can use the plus and minus buttons next to the organisms to increase or decrease their populations.
            And use the {h}Add Organism{/h} button to select a new organism to add.
            We can only simulate one intervention at a time, though, so no adding multiple new organisms or adjusting multiple populations.
