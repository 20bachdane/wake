Notes on what features to add:

Animations: (Involve Routines, will take some time to learn these)
    - Particles coming from boat moving (Started trying this, notes: need different way, since they rotate with boat so it looks bad)
        -Waves go underneath land (land up z)
        - Simulation space world not local.
    - Cursor changing, similar to Autumn's seascene 
    - Particles in background

    -Boat "bobbing"
        -Extension method 

Sound: (Relatively simple I think)
    - Engine noise when moving

Camera: (Have Autumns Camera example to look at)
    - Constraints using a collider, similar to seascene
    
Features: (What kind of features will be needed?)
    - Interact with something?
    - Collect something?

Sprites: 
    -Aseprite to make a sprite for the boat, and adding sprites to the game?
