Notes on what features to add:

Animations: (Involve Routines, will take some time to learn these)
    - Cursor changing, similar to Autumn's seascene 
    - Particles in background


Sound: (Relatively simple I think)
    - Engine noise when moving
    
Features: (What kind of features will be needed?)
    - Interact with something?
    - Collect something?

Sprites: 
    -Aseprite to make a sprite for the boat, and adding sprites to the game?
