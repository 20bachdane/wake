{@kevin}    Alright, looks like this is the job board.
            Seems to have gotten some updates since I last saw one of these.
{@player}   You've seen one of these before?
{@kevin}    An older version of them, yeah.
            You should just be able to select a job on the left...
            Then accept it from the panel on the right.
