Notes for working

Add a timer for NPC responding with multiple nodes

Add the ability for a node to not count as previous node, will allow invalid repsonses, but not make them "invalid"?

Maybe add way to combine invalid? if a link has a invalid use it? Not sure

Split up dialogue into different files?
-nodes
-links
Format them better? Difficult to understand currently

Add a "Claim ID" to only show relevant evidence to one claim?
