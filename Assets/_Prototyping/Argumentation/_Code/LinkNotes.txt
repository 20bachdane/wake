Changing How the links work..

Options:
-Define the links within the journal and store all the data there.
-Define the links in their own file, give the player just linkIds that unlock when they disocover new evidence.


--Likely Define all of the Model/Behavior/Ecosystem links seperate
File would look like:
Model Links:
All links with Model

Player would store all the link Id's that they have found



Potential Issues:
If they try to make a claim that they have not discovered enough evidence for, the conversation would not be able to be finished.
This is solvable by deciding what claims they can choose. Only allow them to choose claims that they can completely describe?
Or allow them to say, an option like let me get more infromation and come back.
