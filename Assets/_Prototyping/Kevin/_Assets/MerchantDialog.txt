{@player}   Okay, we're here.
{@kevin}    {speed 0.5}Great...{/speed}
{@player}   You can sit this out if you want.
{@kevin}    No, no, I'll come along.
            Gotta see this {speed 0.5}famous{/speed} mechanic.
{@player}   Look, please just be pleasant{wait 0.2}, alright?
            I don't want us to get kicked out.
{@kevin}    {wait 0.2}...How long will we be there for?
{@player}   Probably an hour or so.
{@kevin}    {wait 0.5}Fine.
{@player}   Want to ride in the tank?
{@kevin}    No, won't need that.
            Would need to be out a couple hours more for it to be a problem.
            I'll just float on your shoulder.

{wait 1}
{@player}   Hello? Anyone there?
{@mechanic}{speaker: ???} Wha-{wait 1} who's there?
{@player}   Customers!
{@mechanic}{speaker: ???} Oh! Uh... didn't hear you knocking before.
            Come on in, we're open!
{@player}   Um,{wait 0.2} the door's locked.
{@mechanic}{speaker: ???} Ah, whoops. Give me a sec...{wait 0.5} there! Unlocked it for you.
{@player}   Thanks.
{hide} {wait 0.5}
{@mechanic}{speaker: ???} So, have you been here before?
{@player}   Nope! First time.
{@mechanic}{speaker: ???} Oh, not often I get new customers!
{@mechanic} Name's Jan. Best ship mechanic on the island.
            Probably the best you can find anywhere.
            Welcome to my Ship Shop.
{@player}   Nice to meet you. I'm {player_name}.
            And this is -
{@kevin}    {speed 0.25}...{/speed}
{@player}   Haha{wait 0.5}, this is Kevin. They're a little shy today.
{@kevin}    Hi.
{@mechanic} ...Hi! Nice to, uh, meet you both!
            So I figure if you're here, you either want your ship repaired...
            Or you're looking to commission one.
            Or{wait 0.5}, in the unlikely event you're looking for trouble, I swear -
{@player}   No, no, just looking for some repairs!
{@mechanic} Phew! Just repairs. Good.
            Sorry, got nervous there for a sec, haha.
{@player}   Yeah.
{hide} {wait 0.5}
{@mechanic} Right{wait 0.5}, so... repairs.
{@player}   Repairs.
{@mechanic} Let me see your ship.
{hide}

// viewing the player's ship
{wait 2}
{@mechanic} Huh, this is a pretty nice ship!
            Looks like... a KP-203? Phobos class?
{@player}   Yep, that's it. The Carson.
{@mechanic} Got a couple custom parts. Build them yourself?
{@player}   Oh, no, I'm not much of a builder.{n}I salvaged them a year ago.
            Family friend cleaned them up and installed them for me.
{@mechanic} Did you, uh, pay them or anything?
{@player}   No, they just owed me a favor.
{@mechanic} Haha, good.
            I wouldn't have paid for an install like this.
{@player}   Wha-{wait 0.2}{auto}
{@mechanic} Your rudder's misaligned. Can see it breaking a couple months from now.
            Claw could {speed 0.5}definitely{/speed} use a replacement. The chain's all worn.
            Based on the discoloration around the back, your engine's about to die.
            And that decoration you've got...
            Wait, never mind, that looks intentional.
{@player}   But-{wait 0.2}{auto}
{@mechanic} So yeah! I'd say it needs repair.
{@player}   ...That was a fast assessment.
{@mechanic} Haven't been working at this for twenty-nine years for nothing.
{@player}   You said{wait 0.5} the engine's about to die?
{@mechanic} Give it a week, you'll be dead in the water.
{@player}   {wait 0.5}Kevin?
{@kevin}    ...
{@player}   We can't wait that long, can we?
{@kevin}    No.
{@player}   Yeah, thought so.
            Okay, whatever we need, we'll pay for it.
{@mechanic} Excellent! Follow me back inside, let's discuss payment.
{hide}

// back inside
{wait 1}
{@mechanic} So with all that, total comes to... {cash}10,000{/cash}.
{@player}   Wh-{wait 0.2} Ah{wait 0.2}, that's quite a number.
{@mechanic} Yep.
{@player}   ...Anything we could skip?
{@mechanic} Nope. I don't do partial jobs.
{@player}   Uhhhhhhhh... give me one sec.
{hide} {wait 0.5}
{@player}   Kevin, help me out here.
{@kevin}    What? You want me to {wait 0.2}negotiate?
{@player}   You said you have some tricks up your sleeve -
{@kevin}    Metaphorical sleeves, {player_name}
{@player}   - whatever, just do what you need to do.
{@kevin}    ...Fine.
{hide} {wait 0.5}
{@kevin}    Hi.
{@mechanic} Hello again, uh... Kevin?
{@kevin}    Yep, that's correct. Listen, do you do any bartering?
            Trading? Anything like that?
{@mechanic} Well... not {speed 0.5}officially{/speed}.
            But if you have something of interest -
{@kevin}    Oh, we do. {player_name}?
{@player}   Take a look at this.
{hide} {wait 0.5}
{@mechanic} Is that{wait 0.25} what I think it is?
            An {highlight}old world pod{/highlight}?
            I've only seen a handful of those!
            Where did you get this?
{@player}
