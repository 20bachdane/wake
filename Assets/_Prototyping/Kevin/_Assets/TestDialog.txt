<bgm kevindialog_intro>
<t kevin> <speaker: ???> Hello!<wait: 1> I'm Kevin, and I want to be your friend!<wait: 0.2><sfx: full_sync><wait: 1>
<t player><speaker: Player???> Uh, okay??? Not really sure who or what you are<wait: 1><n>but I'll give it a try!
<t kevin><speaker: Kevin, Your Friend!> Great! Let's just make a contract...<wait: 1> you do know how these contracts work, right?
<t player> ...<wait: 0.2>No.
<t kevin><speaker: Kevin, Your... Friend?> Oh, it's really simple! Just<wait 0.1> give me your finger, here...<wait: 0.5><sfx: kevin_stab><bgm_pitch 0.61><wait: 2> done!<wait: 0.2>
<t player>Ouch!<input_continue> Did -<wait 0.2> did you just <wait 0.5>take a sample of my blood? What the -
<t kevin><speaker: Kevin, Who Just Stole Some Of Your Blood>Yes! Our souls are now eternally bound<wait: 1> by <speed 0.5>science</speed>!
<t player>Wait no I don't think I asked for this
<t kevin>From now on, we are scientifically <highlight><speed: 0.4>best<wait 0.3> friends!</speed></highlight>
Isn't that amazing?! Here, let me list off the perks of being my scientific best friend.
<t player>How about no?<wait 1><auto>
<t kevin>One: We can talk telepathically with each other! Doesn't <speed 0.4>sound</speed> scientific, but trust me - <wait 0.2> it works.
Two: We can see the world through each other's eyes whenever we want!<wait 0.5> Again, trust me on this. Soul bonding has some <speed 0.4>sweet</speed> perks.
And three: I can <wait 0.5><speed 0.4>s e e  t h e  f u t u r e</speed>...<wait 0.2> just kidding.
But I CAN help you out on your ship.
Probably.
I've got some tricks up my... sleeve? Is that the expression?
Yeah, up my metaphorical sleeve. That could help us gather information.
So<wait 0.3> what do you say?
<t player>Uhh...<wait 0.5> Do I have a choice in this?
<t kevin><wait 0.2>No.
<t player>...<speed 0.2>great</speed>

// Telepathy Is Hard
<wait 2><bgm kevindialog_mid>
<t kevin>Hey best friend! Welcome back to the helm!
<t player>...Hi Kevin.
<t kevin>You stopped responding out there. Everything alright?
<t player>Sure, yeah.<wait 0.3> Still getting used to the whole, uh, telepathy<wait 0.3> thing.
<t kevin>Can't be that tough! Every other jellyblob I<wait 0.2> knew communicated that way!
<t player>Wait, but then how were you talking to me before we "soul bonded" or whatever?
<t kevin>Practice!
<t player>Wait wha-<wait 0.2><auto>
<t kevin>Just like you need to practice your telepathy!
<t player>But you don't have a mouth!
<t kevin>Sure I do! Just <speed 0.5>really</speed> tiny. Easy to miss it.
And in any case, you owe me some updates!
<t player>Okay, uh, we picked up a new job. From the <wait 0.2>"Urchin Baron"<wait 0.2> apparently.
Says we should visit their station south of here. Then something about urchins?
<t kevin>Sounds... fascinating.
<t player>What, you're not impressed? By the "Urchin Baron"?
<t kevin>Listen, I've known a lot of <wait 0.1>"powerful"<wait 0.1> folks.
NONE of them impress me anymore.

// Urchins, Urchins, Urchins
<wait 2><bgm kevindialog_end>
<t kevin>Hello! Just checking in, <speed = 0.5>best friend</speed>, how's progress going?
<t player>Well, we're getting close to the next kelp forest.
<t kevin>Oooh,<wait 0.2> <speed 0.5>another</speed> kelp forest.<input_continue> How original!
Not like this is the <speed 0.5>fourth one in a row</speed> or anything.
<t player>Come on.
These kelp and urchin jobs are keeping the ship running right now.
<t kevin>I'm just getting tired of "<speed 0.5>urchins, urchins, urchins</speed>."
<t player>I like urchins, okay? Did you know they see -
<t kevin>"with their whole bodies"? Yeah. I know. Way cooler than a jellyblob, right?
<t player>Are you<wait 0.3> jealous? Haha<wait 0.2>, why would you be jealous of an urchin?
Is it because they -
<t kevin>No, it's <wait 0.1>NOT<wait 0.1> because they're getting a lot of attention right now.
I just think...<wait 0.2> it's just neat<wait 0.2>, is all.<wait 0.2> Imagine seeing everything happening around you all the time.
<t player><speed 0.5>Al<wait 0.2></speed>right then. That honestly sounds overwhelming.
But probably useful in a handful of circumstances.
<t kevin>For sure.
How much longer?
<t player>Until we reach the job site? Um... another three hours or so.
<t kevin>Cool.
I'm going to go take a nap.
Wake me when we're like 15 minutes out.
<t player>Sure.
