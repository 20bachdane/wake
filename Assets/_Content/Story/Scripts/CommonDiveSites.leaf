{@guide}  Data inconclusive.
{@player} Wow... it looks like a ghost.
{@player} Where did it come from?
{@guide} Sensors indicate that the anomoly was sent by Challenger Deep.
{@player} That's where Sam is! They must've gotten the probe back online!
{@player} But why would they send this to us?

            Can you pinpoint its origin, {nameof @guide}?

{@guide}	Certainly, O. The specter originated at Challenger Deep.

{@guide}	Affirmative, O. Point of origin: the Challenger Deep probe.
{@player}	I don't understand. Why does Sam keep sending me these ghosts?
            Why haven't they contacted us? 
{@guide}	I'm sorry, O. The data is inconclusive.

            Turns out that wasn't true either.

            A jellyfish? Some kind of crustacean?
{@guide}    I don't believe so, O. 
            The transmission size was too large, so only a portion of the image came through.
{@player}   Yikes. That's not terrifying at all.
{@player}   So what are we looking at here? 
{@guide}    It appears that this is only the eye of a much larger creature.
{@player}   Whoa. An eye?!  
            {nameof @guide}, what are we going to do? Sam is down there with a monster!

{@player}       Yes! Thank you, Tío!
{@kelpMechanic} De nada, Ollie.
                Mer had stored the upgrade on an old data card of hers.
                Took forever to find... had to dig through all her old boxes.
                Come talk to me at the Forested Lagoon, and I'll get the upgrade added to your card!
