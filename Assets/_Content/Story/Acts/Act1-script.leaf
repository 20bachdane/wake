{@drJules}  Oh, a visitor! Welcome to my research station.
            What a gorgeous old ship! 
{@player}   Um, thanks. Still getting used to it. 
{@kevin}    She doesn't even know where the light switches are. 
{@player}   Shhhhhh, Kevin.
{@drJules}   Who's your jellyfish friend?
{@player}    Not "friend," exactly. They're my new passenger. 
             I'm {player-name}. You're Dr. Kelpurnia, right?
{@drJules}  Please, call me Kel. 
            What brings you and your not-friend to my little kelpdom?
{@player}   Well.... I need some cash to pay off my ship.
            Kevin heard you might have some jobs up for grabs. 
{@drJules}  Oh, great! I could use an extra set of hands. 
            Or, you know, tentacles.
            Open your {map-name}Job Board{/map-name} on the dash to get started!
