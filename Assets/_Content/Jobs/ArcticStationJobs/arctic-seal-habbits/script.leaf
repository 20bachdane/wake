{@profArctic} Oh, this is great, Ollie! I've been curious about the Ribbon Seals for so long.
              Though I can't promise you'll see one. They're a pretty rare find. 
{@arcticSci}  It's true. Your sister called them loners... like a lot of us here. 
              I've never seen one, but Juno here has stumbled upon them once or twice--
{@player}     Wait. My sister told you about them?? 
{@arcticSci}  Of course. Legend says she was the first to spot a Ribbon Seal around here.
{@player}   Wow, that's amazing!
            How can I help?
{@profArctic} To start with, you'll need to venture below the ice and track down a Ribbon Seal. 
              Use your {nameof IceBreaker} to reach the {m}Ephemeral Impass{/m}.

{@profArctic} Wow, so many microorganisms! Nice job, Ollie.
              And I can't believe you saw a Ribbon Seal! I've been here 6 years and I've seen one maybe twice. 
              Gorgeous down there, isn't it? 
{@player}     Yeah. A little eerie, too. 
{@profArctic} Really? I find it comforting. All that ice and quiet. 
              But if ice crevices aren't your thing, no biggie. I'm sure I can find someone else for the next job--
{@player}     Oh, there's another job down there?? What is it? When do I leave? 
{@arcticSci}  Well, now you really sound like your sister. 
{@profArctic} It's all yours if you want it, Ollie. Just check the Job Board when you're ready.
