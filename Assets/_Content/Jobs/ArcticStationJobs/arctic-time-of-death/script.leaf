{@profWhalen}   We've had whales die in this area before.  It's called a "whalefall".
                All kinds of creatures use the whale detritus for food.
                We made a descriptive model of a previous whalefall. Take a look.

{@profWhalen}   Have you seen any zombie worms there?
                It looks like the worms might be a good marker of the whale fall stage.

{@profWhalen}   Yes, the whale creates a lot of detritus, but we might be able to determine the stage from the other species.
                how do the species' populations compare with the model i gave you? 
$goto .argue.showZombieWormsWrong

:: argue.zombieWormsEarly
$call ArgueRejectIncorrect()
{@profWhalen}   Interesting, it seems like the zombie worms could have occured earlier.
                Can you check the species populations against the model I gave you and adjust your claim?

{@profWhalen}   Ahhh, yes! These can only live on the whale detritus once the bones are exposed.
                Excellent work {nameof @player}
