{@profWhalen}	Some of our researchers down south have been tracking a certain pod of whales for some time now.
                Recently however, one of our trackers went out, and we haven't been able to find them since.
                The tracker was attached to one of the matriarchs of the pod we call "Linda".
                Would you be able to go check her last known location and see if you can find her?  
{@player}   Can do!
{@profWhalen}  A mother whale is called a Cow, so sending you off to find her makes you a cowboy!
{@player}   When then, I reckon we ought to saddle-up and mosey on over.
{@kevin}    Oh, brother...

{@player} 	What should I be doing again?
{@kevin}	We need to see if we can locate the Linda.
            Why don't you check your AQOS to see her last known location.

{@kevin} Looks like we were able to find her...
{@kevin} Let's head back and let Professor Whalen know.

{@kevin}	We located the whale, so let's report back to Professor Whalen.

{@profWhalen} OK. Get back to me when you're ready.

:: argue.cantFind
{@profWhalen}   She's got to be out there somewhere. I hope something hasn't happened to her...
                Don't come back until you've found some evidence of her.

{@profWhalen}   Oh. With both pieces of evidence... Well, that's unfortunate.
                I'm sure she will be missed by her pod. I wonder who will take over as leader...
                Anywho, thanks for letting us know.
