{@drJules}  Ok. So the {nameof UrchinBarren} isn't looking great.
            But I think we can fix it. 
            There's one more part of the {h}Simulator{/h} I haven't shown you yet.
            Meet me back at the {h}Modeling Whiteboard{/h}.

{@drJules}  This time, we're going to use the modeling tool to {h}predict{/h} what could happen if we intervened with the ecosystem in some way.
            You should have all the rules from your {item-name}Bestiary{/item-name} added already, so hit that {h}Simulate{/h} button!

{@kevin}	Let's start up the {h}Simulator{/h}.

:: InterventionGetSync
@trigger	ModelGraphStarted

@cutscene
{@drJules}  Just like before, you should set up your populations so they match up with the historical populations you got from the {h}Probe{/h}.
            If they line up, our model is good, and then we can use it to {h}predict{/h}.

::ModelHelp2
@trigger    RequestPartnerHelp
@when 		scene:name == "ModelingPrototype", modeling:phase == "model"
@cutscene
{@player} 	How do I do this again?
{@kevin}	Drag the sliders on the left so your model matches the data from Site B.
            Once everything lines up, press the "Sync" button to continue.

{@drJules}  Nice work! Now I need you to see if there's anything we can adjust to make the {critter-name}Kelp{/critter-name} population rise again.
            What would happen if we added {critter-name}Kelp{/critter-name}, or removed {pluralnameof Urchin}, or even...
            Oh, sorry, I have to go for now. Good luck! Come talk to me in the {map-name}Office{/map-name} when you're done!

{@kevin}    Looks like we're on our own. Let's see what we can do.

{@player} 	I'm a bit stuck here - got any tips for me, Kevin?
{@kevin}	We want to change something so the {critter-name}Kelp{/critter-name} population increases to the target on the right.
            It seems like the main problem now is that it keeps getting eaten by {pluralnameof Urchin}.
            I wonder if there's something we could add that would keep the {nameof Urchin} population under control...

{@kevin}    Ok. It looks like we have a plan!
            I have no idea what adding {pluralnameof SeaOtter} practically means, but let's report back to {nameof @drJules} at the {map-name}Office{/map-name}.

	{@kevin}	We've got a model now that shows us what might help Site B, so let's report back to Dr. Kelpurnia.
	{@kevin}	We should first head back to the {map-name}Office{/map-name}.
$else
	{@player} 	So... now what?
	{@kevin}	We can report our findings to Dr. Kelpurnia using the {h}Computer{/h}.

{@drJules}    Okay, so because {pluralnameof Urchin} eat {pluralnameof GiantKelp}, and {pluralnameof SeaOtter} eat {pluralnameof Urchin}...
Adding some {pluralnameof SeaOtter} will ultimately let the {critter-name}Kelp{/critter-name} repopulate!
Now... where to find some otters..
You know what, I'll work on that.
