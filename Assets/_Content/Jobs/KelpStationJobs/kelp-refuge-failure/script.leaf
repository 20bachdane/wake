{@kevin}	We need to get ready to present a quantitative model.
			Start by getting all the data we'll need, like the historical population and the kelp growth rates when stressed and when unstressed.
			Let's start by going to the kelp refuge site to check it out.

:: helpLeaveShip
@trigger    RequestPartnerHelp
@when 		scene:name == "Ship", !jobs:kelp-refuge-failure.seen.bottom
@cutscene
{@player}   Where should I go from here?
{@kevin}	Let's dive into the kelp refuge site and see what's happening.

:: diveSite
@trigger    SceneStart
@when       scene:name == "RS-1D"
@once
@cutscene
$set    	jobs:coral-stressed.seen.bottom = true
{@kevin}	Dr. Kelpurnia was right, there are very few Bull Kelp compared to Giant Kelp.
			Let's see what the population history has been like since the refuge was created. We'll need to scan the population probe.
{@kevin}   	Do you see it anywhere?

:: helpHistorical
@trigger    RequestPartnerHelp
@when 		JobTaskTop(histPop)
@cutscene
{@player}   Where should I go from here?
{@kevin}	We'll need the historical population - check the population probe.

{@kevin}	Measuring the growth rates of kelp is our next priority. Let's surface and get to the Experiment Room.
$set    	jobs:kelp-refuge-failure.collected.probe = true


// EXPERIMENTS

@when 		scene:name != "ExperimentV2", jobs:kelp-refuge-failure.collected.probe == true, !JobTaskTop(newModel), !JobTaskTop(getPaid)
@cutscene
{@player}   Where should I go from here?
{@kevin}	Let's head to the {h}Measurement Tank{/h} to measure Kelp growth rates.

:: startExperiment
@trigger	ExperimentTankViewed
@when		tankType == "Measurement"
@once
@cutscene
{@kevin}	We need the growth rates of kelp when stressed and unstressed.
			Growth rate means put in only one species and make sure it's fed and stabilized.
			What site should we replicate?

:: helpAtExperiment
@trigger    RequestPartnerHelp
@when 		scene:name == "ExperimentV2", !JobTaskTop(newModel), !JobTaskTop(getPaid)
@cutscene
{@player} 	How should I do this again?
{@kevin}	We need the growth rates of kelp when stressed and unstressed.
			What sites do we know they are stressed in, and which do we know they're not stressed in?

:: experimentEnd
@trigger    JobTasksUpdated
@when 		HasFact(GiantKelp.Reproduce), HasFact(GiantKelp.Reproduce.Stressed), HasFact(BullKelp.Reproduce), HasFact(BullKelp.Reproduce.Stressed)
@once
@cutscene
{@kevin}	Fantastic! The {h}Measurement Tank{/h} gave us some new clues.
			Now we need to build a model that incorporates all of this data so we can be certain of what's causing {nameof BullKelp} to grow more slowly.
			We should head to the Modeling room for that.


// MODELING	

			
:: helpBeginModel

{@player} 	What do we need to do now?
{@kevin}	Now we need to build a model.

:: modelingStart
@trigger    SceneStart
@when 		JobTaskTop(newModel), scene:name == "Modeling"
@once
@cutscene
{@kevin}	Let's input the data we've gathered and see if we can get a model that matches historical data.

:: lightDeecreaseModelingComplete
@trigger	SimulationSyncSuccess
@once
@cutscene
{@kevin}	We've solved it! Let's tell Dr. Kelpurnia the good news.

:: helpReportBack
@trigger    RequestPartnerHelp
@when 		JobTaskTop(getPaid)
@cutscene
{@player} 	What do we need to do now?
{@kevin}	The communications room is where we should go to share your findings.

{@drKelp} So why didn't the Refuge work for the {nameof BullKelp}?
	$choice .argue.wrongTemp; It's the wrong temperature.
	$choice .argue.slowGrowth; The Bull Kelp are growing more slowly than expected.
	$choice .argue.pickyUrchins; The urchins are only eating the Bull Kelp.

$choose branch

{@drKelp} OK. Get back to me when you're ready.

::argue.wrongTemp
{@drKelp}	We already know that Bull Kelp should thrive at 14Â°C. It must be something else.
$goto .argue.chooseClaim

::argue.pickyUrchins
{@drKelp}	Hmmm. We know that Urchins eat both Kelp. Do you have another theory?
$goto .argue.chooseClaim

::argue.slowGrowth
{@drKelp}	Show me your model. Does it explain why the {nameof BullKelp} are growing more slowly?

{@drKelp}	Wow. So both were doing fine, but the {nameof GiantKelp} started blocking the light, making the {nameof GiantKelp} stressed.
{@drKelp}	That does explain it.
{@drKelp}	I guess it's back to the drawing board for this Refuge idea.

{@drKelp} That doesn't explain it. Did you make a model of the site?
