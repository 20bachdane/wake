{@profBayou}  Thank you, Ollie,  
              We need to assess whether the oil rig reef can stay without harming the ecosystem, or if it needs to be removed.
             Can you take your sub out and get an estimated count of all the local species? 
{@player}    Sure, Professor. Happy to help.

{@player} This is so wild. A whole new ecosystem growing on an old oil rig!
{@player} That Silias guy doesn't seem happy about it, though. 
{@guide} Processing "Silias"..... 
{@guide} Records found. Esteemed marine scientist. The youngest in a long line of shrimpers. 
{@player} Shrimpers?
{@guide} Humans who make a living fishing for shrimp. 
{@player} Hmm. I haven't seen many shrimp around here.  
{@player} No wonder the guy's grumpy.

{@profBayou} Okay Ollie, let's analyze the data you uncovered for the species at {nameof O_OilRig}.
             First what are the populatrions for the {pluralnameof LoggerheadTurtle}, {pluralnameof SeaPearl}, and {pluralnameof ElkhornCoral}?

{@profBayou} Hmmm. Nice work, Ollie. 
{@profBayou} I need to consider this and plan our next move. 
{@bayouSci} Aw, you gotta be kiddin' me, Harper. 
            The turtles were here first. Then these new critters moved in and started takin' over.
            If you ask me, we need that reef outta here yesterday! Right, kid?
{@player}   Oh... um...
            I'm not really used to making these kind of decisions...
{@profBayou} It's too early to decide anything, Silias. We need more data. 
{@profBayou} Ollie, let me know if you'd like to help out again. I'm sure I'll have more work for you soon.
