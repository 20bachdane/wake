{@profHarper}   Have you explored the {h}Bayou Station{/h} yet? There appears to be a new reef growing in the middle of {h}Site O{/h}. 
                Would you be able to go pop over and help us report back on what exactly is growing over there?
{@player}   You can count on me!

	{@profHarper} If you switch it on and move close to a scanned species, the {nameof ROVTagger} will {h}count{/h} it.
	{@profHarper} Count enough of them and your {nameof ROVTagger} will do the rest and give you a population estimate.
	{@profHarper} Go ahead and give it a try!
