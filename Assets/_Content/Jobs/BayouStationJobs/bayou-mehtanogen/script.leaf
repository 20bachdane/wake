// write an intro to your job
{@profBayou}  Ollie, these {pluralnameof Methanogen} you discovered at Site N are incredible!  
{@bayouSci}   Welp, that's an understatement if I ever heard one.
              She's been gabbing on about them all day. Our dear professor is ob-sessed.
{@profBayou}  I prefer the word "focused." Or possibly "engrossed."
              Ollie, can you help me figure out how they're able to survive in such a hostile environment? 
{@player}     Yes! I'd love to, Professor. 
{@profBayou}  Excellent. I need you to determine their rates of consumption, reproduction, and water chemistry interaction.
              I'd also like to know what stresses them, if anything.
{@player}     I'm on it, Professor. I'll report back soon.

{@player} What should we do first, {nameof @guide}?
{@guide}  Head to the {m}Experiment Lab{/m} to get started!

{@player}  Ahh! This is so exciting, {nameof @guide}!
           My sister and I used to dream of learning about new species like this.
{@guide}   Yes. And we'll get to collect so much fascinating data!!

:: helpExperiment

{@player} So what's our next step, {nameof @guide}?
{@guide}  You'll need to use all of our Tanks to obtain the facts listed in your {item}AQOS{/item}!

{@player} Okay, {nameof @guide}. Do we have everything?
{@guide}  Affirmative, O. It's time to report your findings to {nameof @profBayou}!

              How are the {pluralnameof Methanogen} able to thrive in such a hostile environment?
