{@profBayou} We need to learn more about the ecosystem down at {h}Site N{/h}.
            No sunlight reaches there. Something else must be keeping the organisms alive. 
            Ollie, I'd like you to create a visual model to show how energy flows through the ecosystem. 
$if HasEntity(Detritus), HasEntity(VentStar), HasEntity(Methanogen), HasEntity(Methane)
    //Has all entities from Site N
    $if HasFact(VentStar.Eats.Detritus), HasFact(Methanogen.Eats.H_Gas)
        //Has all eat rules
        {@profBayou}  Using the data you've already gathered data from Site N, so you can head straight to your {h}Modeling Lab{/h}.
    $else
        //Missing some eat rules
        {@guide}    First, you'll need to do some experiments to see how these organisms relate to one another.
    $endif  
$else
    //Missing some entities from Site N
    {@guide}    You'll need to finish scanning all the critters at {h}Site N{/h} to create a comprehensive model.

{@player} Wow. This is amazing, {nameof @guide}!
{@player} It looks like this ecosystem has more than one source of power.
{@guide}  Yes. And so much wonderful data!
{@player} I never would've guessed there could be so much energy in all that darkness.
          Can't wait to tell {nameof @profBayou}!

{@bayouSci}   I gotta admit, that's a pretty cool finding, kid. Maybe even groundbreaking. 
              I'll keep lookin' into it after the professor moves on outta here. You can help me, if you like. 
{@player}     That would be amazing! Thanks, Silias. 
{@profBayou}  Actually... I might end up sticking around the Bayou, too. This new ecosystem merits further study. 
{@bayouSci}   Ah.... that's, um... that's somethin', Professor. Can't wait to keep workin' with you.
