{@profCempaka}	You scanned plastic!? In the reef? This won't do.
{@profCempaka}  What will happen if the makes its way to the Reef Edge?
$if JobTaskTop(scanReefEdge)
    {@profCempaka}  Head to the Reef Edge at Site V to construct a food web for the Loggerhead Turtle.
    {@player}       We're on our way!
$elseif JobTaskTop(whatTurtlesEat)
    {@profCempaka}  Experiment in the Observation tank with the organisms you've scanned in the Reef Edge at Site V.
    {@player}       On it!
$else
    {@profCempaka}  Take what you know about the Reef Edge at Site V interactions and construct a food web for the Loggerhead Turtle.
    {@player}       Copy that!
