{@kevin} 	Go to {h}Site S{/h} and scan all species.



// EXPERIMENT
	

:: helpExperiment

@when       JobTaskTop(observeEatAlgae) // BRANCH B

{@kevin} 	Use the Observation Tank to determine what eats {nameof TurfAlgae} and is native to Site S.

@once

{@kevin} 	All right, so it's the {nameof BlueTang} that eat {nameof TurfAlgae}.

:: helpMeasure
@trigger    RequestPartnerHelp
@when       JobTaskTop(measureEatRate) // BRANCH C
@cutscene
{@kevin} 	Use the Measurement Tank to get the rate that {nameof BlueTang} eat {nameof TurfAlgae}.

// MODELING

:: helpBuildModel
@trigger    RequestPartnerHelp
@when       JobTaskTop(modelPopulations) // BRANCH D
@cutscene
{@kevin} 	Build a {map-name}Descriptive Model{/map-name} of the {h}Site S{/h} ecosystem, focusing on the {nameof BlueTang} and {nameof TurfAlgae}.

:: inModeling

@when		scene:name == "Modeling"

@cutscene
{@kevin}	You'll need to build a Visual Model first, if you haven't done that yet. Then make a Descriptive Model so we can compare it to the empirical data.

@boostScore 1060 // higher than generic script
@when		scene:name == "Modeling", !JobTaskCompleted(histPop)
@cutscene
{@kevin}	I think we're missing some critical population data. When making a Sync model, the program needs historical population data to check against. 
			We should head back to Site S and scan the population data before we try to do anything here.

//modeling needs historical data for all the species to validate against

:: modelingComplete
@trigger	JobTasksUpdated
@when		scene:name == "Modeling", JobTaskTop(reportBack)
@once
@cutscene
{@kevin}	We have a model, but for some reason it doesn't match what we've observed. The {nameof BlueTang} aren't eating as much as we'd expect.
			Let's talk through it with {nameof profCempaka}.
