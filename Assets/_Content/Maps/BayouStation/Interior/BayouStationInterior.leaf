{@profBayou}    Oh, hello! Welcome to the Bayou Station!
                This is an exciting time to be a Bayou researcher!
{@player}   Oh yeah?
{@profBayou}    I'll be sure to send some jobs your way that will show you how totally mystifying the Bayou can be.
                I'm looking forward to working with you!
