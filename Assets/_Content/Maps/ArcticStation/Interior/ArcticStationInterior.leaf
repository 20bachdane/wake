{@arcticSci}    Oh my. You must be.... ah.
{@profArctic}   Don't scare the kid away, Jacques.  
{@profArctic}   Welcome to the Arctic Station! I'm the lead scientist here. You can call me Juno. 
                You're Ollie, right?
{@player}       Um... yes. How did you know?
{@profArctic}   Professor Whalen here used to work with your sister.
                He still talks about her work all the time. Meredith is a legend around here. 
{@player}       Wait... for real? You taught my sister?
{@arcticSci}   Taught her? No. Mer was a prodigy. I could barely keep up.
                You look so much like her. It's uncanny.
{@player}       Wow. I would love to hear more stories about her! 
                Have you lived out here all this time, Professor? 
{@arcticSci}    No. I'm only here for one task... seeking out a Bowhead Whale that I've lost track of. 
                I would love your help. I sure have been worried about her.
