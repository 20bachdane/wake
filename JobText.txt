Job:	arctic-salmon-competition
Name:	Salmon Competition
Description:	Well, you really have proven useful. We have been trying to make a model about Salmon summering in the arctic. We aren't happy with how our model is working, but maybe your information about cod could be used to improve it.

Job:	arctic-salmon-monitoring
Name:	Salmon Monitoring
Description:	Our whole job is to monitor the salmon out here at <#ffccf9>Site Z: Frosted Sea</color>. We don't typically get help for it, so we weren't expecting any. Uh... I suppose you can double check our salmon counts?

Job:	arctic-seal-habitats
Name:	Seal Habitats
Description:	The <#fff27e>Ribbon Seals</color> have been almost a myth for decades because we have struggled to properly observe them. They live in the <#ffccf9>Ephemeral Impass</color> within the ice shelf, which are unique spaces due to the microscopic species that live there. Can you find the seals and gather data on their habitat?

Job:	arctic-stationary-survival
Name:	Stationary Survival
Description:	We didn't think an ecosystem would be able to survive with such a low amount of light under the ice. Yet, some species are thriving!  How is this possible? Where is the energy coming from if not the sun?
